### Welcome!
This is a fork of the most used tool to automatize the partition SWITCH operations in SQL Server ([https://sqlpartitionmgmt.codeplex.com/](https://sqlpartitionmgmt.codeplex.com/)).

I decided to fork the project because it seems that Stuart Ozer abandoned it (the last update was on November 28, 2012). I also added/fixed something as you can see in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/lucazav/sqlserverpartitionmanager/wiki/Release-Notes).

If you want to collaborate, you're welcome! :) Just let me know and I'll add you as a contributor.
